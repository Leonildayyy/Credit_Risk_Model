# Credit Risk Modeling in Python  

This project is based on the Udemy course **"A Complete Data Science Case Study: Preprocessing, Modeling, Model Validation and Maintenance in Python"**.  

The goal of the project is to build a **Probability of Default (PD) model** for credit risk, following the full data science pipeline.  

## ðŸ”Ž Workflow  

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handle missing values  
   - Encode categorical variables  
   - Normalize and scale numerical variables  
   - Split into training and testing sets  

2. **Modeling**  
   - Logistic Regression as the baseline model  
   - Additional classifiers for comparison (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest)  
   - Hyperparameter tuning  

3. **Model Validation**  
   - Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score  
   - ROC Curve & AUC  
   - Cross-validation for stability  

4. **Model Maintenance**  
   - Monitoring performance over time  
   - Handling data drift  
   - Updating the model with new data
